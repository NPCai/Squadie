Most however have a reversing mechanism which additionally can provide means for saving steam as speed and momentum are gained by gradually "shortening the cutoff" or rather, shortening the admission event; this in turn proportionately lengthens the expansion period. shortening the cutoff the admission event
However, as one and the same valve usually controls both steam flows, a short cutoff at admission adversely affects the exhaust and compression periods which should ideally always be kept fairly constant; if the exhaust event is too brief, the totality of the exhaust steam cannot evacuate the cylinder, choking it and giving excessive compression ("kick back").[citation needed] kick back excessive compression

The investigation of the pathogen that caused the 19th-century plague was begun by teams of scientists who visited Hong Kong in 1894, among whom was the French-Swiss bacteriologist Alexandre Yersin, after whom the pathogen was named Yersinia pestis. yersinia pestis Alexandre Yersin
The mechanism by which Y. pestis was usually transmitted was established in 1898 by Paul-Louis Simond and was found to involve the bites of fleas whose midguts had become obstructed by replicating Y. pestis several days after feeding on an infected host. Paul - Louis Simond mechanism by which Y. pestis was usually transmitted

Estimates of plague victims are usually extrapolated from figures from the clergy. the clergy can population estimates be from
Most work has been done on the spread of the plague in England, and even estimates of overall population at the start vary by over 100% as no census was undertaken between the time of publication of the Domesday Book and the year 1377. no census 1377
In addition to arguing that the rat population was insufficient to account for a bubonic plague pandemic, sceptics of the bubonic plague theory point out that the symptoms of the Black Death are not unique (and arguably in some accounts may differ from bubonic plague); that transference via fleas in goods was likely to be of marginal significance; and that the DNA results may be flawed and might not have been repeated elsewhere, despite extensive samples from other mass graves. rat population was insufficient might rats not responsible for the plague

Other arguments include the lack of accounts of the death of rats before outbreaks of plague between the 14th and 17th centuries; temperatures that are too cold in northern Europe for the survival of fleas; that, despite primitive transport systems, the spread of the Black Death was much faster than that of modern bubonic plague; that mortality rates of the Black Death appear to be very high; that, while modern bubonic plague is largely endemic as a rural disease, the Black Death indiscriminately struck urban and rural areas; and that the pattern of the Black Death, with major outbreaks in the same areas separated by 5 to 15 years, differs from modern bubonic plague—which often becomes endemic for decades with annual flare-ups. many years 5 to 15

There are infinitely many primes, as demonstrated by Euclid around 300 BC. Euclid prime numbers
The first result in that direction is the prime number theorem, proven at the end of the 19th century, which says that the probability that a given, randomly chosen number n is prime is inversely proportional to its number of digits, or to the logarithm of n. the prime number theorem end of the 19th century
Accordingly, the term odd prime refers to any prime number greater than 2. odd prime name is to any prime number larger than 2
Similarly, when written in the usual decimal system, all prime numbers larger than 5 end in 1, 3, 7, or 9, since even numbers are multiples of 2 and numbers ending in 0 or 5 are multiples of 5. type of numbers even
Most early Greeks did not even consider 1 to be a number, so they could not consider it to be a prime. number 1

The origin of electric and magnetic fields would not be fully explained until 1864 when James Clerk Maxwell unified a number of earlier theories into a set of 20 scalar equations, which were later reformulated into 4 vector equations by Oliver Heaviside and Josiah Willard Gibbs. 1864 did the origins of magnetic and electric fields
This final modification to electromagnetic theory ultimately led to quantum electrodynamics (or QED), which fully describes all electromagnetic phenomena as being mediated by wave–particles known as photons. quantum electrodynamics did electromagnetic theory   finally to

However, these characteristics actually result from the Pauli exclusion principle.[citation needed] Since electrons are fermions, they cannot occupy the same quantum mechanical state as other electrons. Pauli exclusion principle actually rigidity in matter
This means that it takes energy to pack them together. energy is to pack electrons densely together
The strong force only acts directly upon elementary particles. stong force elementary particles
However, a residual of the force is observed between hadrons (the best known example being the force that acts between nucleons in atomic nuclei) as the nuclear force. residual of the force can be between hadrons
However, a residual of the force is observed between hadrons (the best known example being the force that acts between nucleons in atomic nuclei) as the nuclear force. nuclear nucleons
Here the strong force acts indirectly, transmitted as gluons, which form part of the virtual pi and rho mesons, which classically transmit the nuclear force (see this topic for more). nuclear forces as gluons
This phenomenon is called color confinement. color confinement obsevable free quarks
The weak force is due to the exchange of the heavy W and Z bosons. the W and Z boson exchange weak force
Its most familiar effect is beta decay (of neutrons in atomic nuclei) and the associated radioactivity. beta decay W and Z boson exchange
Its most familiar effect is beta decay (of neutrons in atomic nuclei) and the associated radioactivity. radioactivity beta decay
When their electron clouds overlap, Pauli repulsion (due to fermionic nature of electrons) follows resulting in the force that acts in a direction normal to the surface interface between two objects.:93 fermionic nature of electrons Pauli repulsion
The normal force, for example, is responsible for the structural integrity of tables and floors as well as being the force that responds whenever an external force pushes on a solid object. normal structures
Tension forces can be modeled using ideal strings that are massless, frictionless, unbreakable, and unstretchable. ideal strings can be to model tension forces
They can be combined with ideal pulleys, which allow ideal strings to switch physical direction. you ideal pulleys
Ideal strings transmit tension forces instantaneously in action-reaction pairs so that if two objects are connected by an ideal string, any force directed along the string by the first object is accompanied by a force directed along the string in the opposite direction by the second object. action-reaction pairs In what way do strings transmit tesion forces
For every string that acts on a load, another factor of the tension force in the string acts on the load. every string can the tension force on a load
Newton's laws and Newtonian mechanics in general were first developed to describe how forces affect idealized point particles rather than three-dimensional objects. Newton 's mechanics idealized point particles
Newton's laws and Newtonian mechanics in general were first developed to describe how forces affect idealized point particles rather than three-dimensional objects. Newton 's mechanics three-dimensional objects
However, in real life, matter has extended structure and forces that act on one part of an object might affect other parts of an object. a force on one part of an object other parts
The stress tensor accounts for forces that cause all strains (deformations) including also tensile stresses and compressions.:133–134:38- deformations strain in structures
This formalism includes pressure terms associated with forces that act normal to the cross-sectional area (the matrix diagonals of the tensor) as well as shear terms associated with forces that act parallel to the cross-sectional area (the off-diagonal elements). pressure terms are with normal forces
This means that the unbalanced centripetal force felt by any object is always directed toward the center of the curving path. centripetal force center of the curving path.
This yields both the tangential force, which accelerates the object by either slowing it down or speeding it up, and the radial (centripetal) force, which changes its direction. force centripetal
This yields both the tangential force, which accelerates the object by either slowing it down or speeding it up, and the radial (centripetal) force, which changes its direction. radial centripetal force
A conservative force that acts on a closed system has an associated mechanical work that allows energy to convert only between kinetic or potential forms. potential energy kinetic

The force, therefore, is related directly to the difference in potential energy between two different locations in space, and can be considered to be an artifact of the potential field in the same way that the direction and amount of a flow of water can be considered to be an artifact of the contour map of the elevation of an area. difference in potential energy two locations related to
For certain physical scenarios, it is impossible to model forces as being due to gradient of potentials. What forces
For certain physical scenarios, it is impossible to model forces as being due to gradient of potentials. gradient of potentials some forces due to that are impossible to model
For example, friction is caused by the gradients of numerous electrostatic potentials between the atoms, but manifests as a force model that is independent of any macroscale position vector. electrostatic gradiient potentials friction
Nonconservative forces other than friction include other contact forces, tension, compression, and drag. Tension , compression , and drag Nonconservative
In macroscopic closed systems, nonconservative forces act to change the internal energies of the system, and are often associated with the transfer of heat. nonconservative forces macroscopic closed system energies
